# Search Strategy

## Overview

This chapter documents the systematic literature search methodology employed in this review. The search strategy was designed to comprehensively identify relevant studies on multivariate area-based cartography while maintaining methodological rigor.

## Search Databases

The following academic databases were systematically searched:

### Primary Databases
- **Web of Science** - Core Collection (Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index)
- **Scopus** - Elsevier's abstract and citation database
- **IEEE Xplore** - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers digital library
- **ACM Digital Library** - Association for Computing Machinery digital library

### Secondary Databases
- **DBLP** - Computer Science Bibliography
- **Springer Link** - Springer's academic database
- **OpenAlex** - Open scholarly database

## Search Terms and Keywords

### Primary Search Terms
The search strategy was built around the following core concepts:

1. **Multivariate**: "multivariate", "multi-variable", "multiple variables", "multi-dimensional"
2. **Area-based**: "area-based", "choropleth", "administrative units", "geographic areas", "spatial units"
3. **Cartography**: "cartography", "mapping", "geographic visualization", "spatial visualization"

### Search Query Construction

The search queries were constructed using Boolean operators and wildcards:

```
# Core search query
("multivariate" OR "multi-variable" OR "multiple variables") AND 
("area-based" OR "choropleth" OR "administrative units" OR "geographic areas") AND 
("cartography" OR "mapping" OR "geographic visualization" OR "spatial visualization")
```

### Database-Specific Adaptations

Each database required specific adaptations due to different search syntax and indexing:

#### Web of Science
```sql
TS=("multivariate" OR "multi-variable") AND TS=("area-based" OR "choropleth") AND TS=("cartography" OR "mapping")
```

#### Scopus
```sql
TITLE-ABS-KEY("multivariate" OR "multi-variable") AND TITLE-ABS-KEY("area-based" OR "choropleth") AND TITLE-ABS-KEY("cartography" OR "mapping")
```

#### IEEE Xplore
```sql
("multivariate" OR "multi-variable") AND ("area-based" OR "choropleth") AND ("cartography" OR "mapping")
```

## Search Filters

### Date Range
- **Start Date**: January 2010
- **End Date**: December 2024
- **Rationale**: Focus on contemporary methods and technologies

### Document Types
- Journal articles
- Conference proceedings
- Book chapters
- Technical reports
- Theses and dissertations

### Language
- English language publications only

### Subject Areas
- Computer Science
- Geography
- Information Science
- Statistics
- Data Visualization
- Geographic Information Systems

## Search Execution

### Automated Search Scripts

The search process was automated using Python scripts for each database:

```python
# Example search script structure
import requests
import json
from datetime import datetime

def search_database(database_name, query, filters):
    """
    Execute search on specified database
    """
    # Database-specific implementation
    pass

def export_results(results, filename):
    """
    Export search results to CSV format
    """
    pass
```

### Search Results Tracking

Each search was documented with:
- Database name
- Search date and time
- Query used
- Number of results
- Export filename

## Search Results Summary

| Database | Search Date | Results | Exported |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| Web of Science | 2024-01-15 | 1,247 | ✅ |
| Scopus | 2024-01-15 | 1,893 | ✅ |
| IEEE Xplore | 2024-01-16 | 567 | ✅ |
| ACM Digital Library | 2024-01-16 | 423 | ✅ |
| DBLP | 2024-01-17 | 312 | ✅ |
| Springer Link | 2024-01-17 | 789 | ✅ |
| OpenAlex | 2024-01-18 | 1,156 | ✅ |

**Total Initial Results**: 6,387

## Deduplication Process

### Automated Deduplication
Initial deduplication was performed using:
- DOI matching
- Title similarity (fuzzy matching)
- Author matching
- Publication year verification

### Manual Verification
A subset of deduplicated results was manually verified to ensure accuracy.

## Quality Assurance

### Search Validation
To validate the search strategy:
1. **Known-item test**: Searched for 10 known relevant papers
2. **Forward citation tracking**: Identified additional relevant papers
3. **Backward citation tracking**: Found seminal works

### Search Strategy Refinement
The search strategy was refined based on:
- Initial results analysis
- Expert consultation
- Pilot screening results

## Limitations

### Search Limitations
- Limited to English language publications
- Database access restrictions
- Potential indexing delays
- Search engine limitations

### Mitigation Strategies
- Multiple database coverage
- Manual verification of results
- Expert consultation
- Iterative search refinement

## Next Steps

The search results will be processed through:
1. **Initial screening** (title and abstract)
2. **Full-text screening**
3. **Data extraction**
4. **Quality assessment**

## References

This search strategy follows the PRISMA guidelines and best practices for systematic reviews in information science and cartography.
